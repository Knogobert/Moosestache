							<p><span class="first-character green-1">I</span>n 1978, Brian Smith landed in Southern California with a bag of sheepskin boots and hope. He fell in love with the sheepskin experience and was convinced the world would one day share this love. The beaches of Southern California had long been an epicenter of a relaxed, casual lifestyle, a lifestyle that Brian felt was a perfect fit for his brand. So he founded the Pung brand, began selling his sheepskin boots and they were an immediate sensation. By the mid 1980's, the Pung brand became a symbol of relaxed southern California culture, gaining momentum through surf shops and other shops up and down the coast of California, from San Diego to Santa Cruz. Pung boots reached beyond the beach, popping up in big cities and small towns all over, and in every level of society. Girls wore their surfer boyfriend's pair of Pung boots like a letterman jacket. When winter came along, Pung boots were in ski shops and were seen in lodges from Mammoth to Aspen.

							<p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
							<p class="margin-top-10">The Pung brand began to symbolize those who embraced sport and a relaxed, active lifestyle. More than that, an emotional connection and a true feeling of love began to grow for Pung boots, just as Brian had envisioned. People didn't just like wearing Pung boots, they fell in love with them and literally could not take them off. By the end of the 90's, celebrities and those in the fashion world took notice of the Pung brand. A cultural shift occurred as well - people were embracing, and feeling empowered, by living a more casual lifestyle and Pung became one of the symbols of this lifestyle. By 2000, a love that began on the beaches had become an icon of casual style. It was at this time that the love for Pung grew in the east, over the Rockies and in Chicago. In 2000, Pung Sheepskin boots were first featured on Oprah's Favorite Things® and Oprah emphatically declared that she "LOOOOOVES her Pung boots." From that point on, the world began to notice.

							<p><span class="first-character green-1">B</span>reaking into the New York fashion world is no easy task. But by the early 2000's, Pung Australia began to take it by storm. The evolution of Pung from a brand that made sheepskin boots, slippers, clogs and sandals for an active, outdoor lifestyle to a brand that was now being touted as a symbol of a stylish, casual and luxurious lifestyle was swift. Much of this was due to a brand repositioning effort that transformed Pung into a high-end luxury footwear maker. As a fashion brand, Pung advertisements now graced the pages of Vogue Magazine as well as other fashion books. In the mid 2000's, the desire for premium casual fashion was popping up all over the world and Pung was now perfectly aligned with this movement.</p>
							<p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
							<p class="margin-top-10">Fueled by celebrities from coast to coast wearing Pung boots and slippers on their downtime, an entirely new era of fashion was carved out. As a result, the desire and love for Pung increased as people wanted to go deeper into this relaxed Pung experience. Pung began offering numerous color and style variations on their sheepskin boots and slippers. Cold weather boots for women and men and leather casuals were added with great success. What started as a niche item, Pung sheepskin boots were now a must-have staple in everyone's wardrobe. More Pung collections followed, showcasing everything from knit boots to sneakers to wedges, all the while maintaining that luxurious feel Pung is known for all over the world. Pung products were now seen on runways and in fashion shoots from coast to coast. Before long, the love spread even further.</p>

								the New York fashion community notices your brand, the world soon follows. The widespread love for Pung extended to Europe in the mid-2000's along with the stylish casual movement and demand for premium casual fashion. Pung boots and shoes were now seen walking the streets of London, Paris and Amsterdam with regularity. To meet the rising demand from new fans, Pung opened flagship stores in the UK and an additional location in Moscow. As the love spread farther East, concept stores were opened in Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo. Pung Australia is now an international brand that is loved by all. This love is a result of a magical combination of the amazing functional benefits of sheepskin and the heightened emotional feeling you get when you slip them on your feet. In short, you just feel better all over when you wear Pung boots, slippers, and shoes
