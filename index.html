							<p><span class="first-character">W</span>ash­ing­ton scientists have recently con­ceded that, if there were a nuclear war, all that would remain are cock­roaches and Chuck Nor­ris. The Great Wall of China was orig­i­nally cre­ated to keep Chuck Nor­ris out. It failed mis­ser­ably. Chuck Nor­ris has never blinked in his entire life. Never.  If Chuck Nor­ris is late, time bet­ter slow the f*ck down Play­girl mag­a­zine once asked Chuck Nor­ris to appear naked in an issue, Chuck laughed at the oppor­tu­nity say­ing “there isn’t enough paper in the world to con­tain my bearded mem­ber”. He then killed the edi­tors sim­ply by unzip­ping his pants. Chuck Nor­ris isn’t lac­tose intol­er­ant. He just doesn’t put up with lactose’s sh*t.  When you open a can of whoop-ass, Chuck Nor­ris jumps out. Chuck Nor­ris is Luke Skywalker’s real father. Chuck Nor­ris’ iPod came with a real charger instead of just a USB cord Rudolph has a red nose because he got lippy and Chuck Nor­ris round­house kicked him across the face sev­eral times Chuck Nor­ris invented a lan­guage that incor­po­rates karate and round­house kicks.

							<p class="margin-top-10">So next time Chuck Nor­ris is kick­ing your ass, don’t be offended or hurt, he may be just try­ing to tell you he likes your hat.  Chuck Nor­ris owns the great­est poker face of all-time. It helped him win the 1983 world series of poker despite him hold­ing just a joker, a 2 of clubs, a 7 of spades, and a green num­ber 4 from Uno and a monop­oly ‘get out of jail free’ card.  Chuck Nor­ris ordered a Big Mac at Burger King, and got one. Chuck Nor­ris does not hunt because the word hunt­ing infers the prob­a­bil­ity of fail­ure. Chuck Nor­ris goes killing. When Chuck Nor­ris was denied a Bacon McMuf­fin at McDon­alds because it was 10:35, he round­house kicked the store so hard it became a KFC. Chuck Nor­ris once kicked a baby ele­phant into puberty.

							<p><span class="first-character">N</span>or­ris never gets ill. Chuck Nor­ris is Luke Skywalker’s real father. Chuck Nor­ris doesn’t need to swal­low when eat­ing food. Chuck Nor­ris owns the great­est poker face of all-time. It helped him win the 1983 world series of poker despite him hold­ing just a joker, a 2 of clubs, a 7 of spades, and a green num­ber 4 from Uno and a monop­oly ‘get out of jail free’ card.  Chuck Nor­ris once broke the land speed record on a bicy­cle that was miss­ing its chain and the back tire. Chuck Nor­ris is Luke Skywalker’s real father. Once a griz­zly bear threat­ened to eat Chuck Nor­ris. Chuck showed the bear his fist and the bear pro­ceeded to eat him­self, because it would be the less painful way to die. Chuck Nor­ris always has cheddar dip on the first date. Always. Film­ing on loca­tion for Walker: Texas Ranger, Chuck Nor­ris brought a still­born baby lamb back to life by giv­ing it a pro­longed beard rub.</p>

							<p class="margin-top-10">As Oswald shot, Chuck Nor­ris met all three bul­lets with his beard, deflect­ing them. JFK’s head exploded out of sheer amaze­ment. Once a griz­zly bear threat­ened to eat Chuck Nor­ris. Chuck showed the bear his fist and the bear pro­ceeded to eat him­self, because it would be the less painful way to die. Chuck Nor­ris once com­mented, “There are few prob­lems in this world that can­not be solved by a swift round­house kick to the face. In fact, there are none.“Chuck Nor­ris once ate an entire ream of rice paper and shat out origami swans and Mis­ter Miyagi from Karate Kid. If paper beats rock, rock beats scis­sors, and scis­sors beats paper, what beats all 3 at the same time? Answer: Chuck Nor­ris.  Chuck Nor­ris is ten feet tall, weighs two-tons, breathes fire, and could eat a ham­mer and take a shot­gun blast stand­ing.  When Chuck Nor­ris had surgery, the anes­the­sia was applied to the doc­tors. The Four Horse­men of the Apoc­a­lypse actu­ally live in Chuck Norris’s nut­sack. Although it is not com­mon knowl­edge, there are actu­ally three sides to the Force: the light side, the dark side, and Chuck Nor­ris.</p>

							<p><span class="first-character">C</span>huck Nor­ris eats trans­former toys in vehi­cle mode and poos them out trans­formed into a robot.  After much debate, Pres­i­dent Tru­man decided to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima rather than the alter­na­tive of send­ing Chuck Nor­ris. It was more “humane”. If you want a list of Chuck Nor­ris’ ene­mies, just check the extinct species list.  Chuck Nor­ris’ evil twin brother, Richard Sim­mons, once approached Chuck with the hope of rec­on­cil­i­a­tion, but at the sight of Richard’s curly, well kept hair, Chuck Nor­ris became so enraged that he turned green with hate and ripped Richard Sim­mons arms and legs off. This action was the ori­gin of the Mar­vel Comic badass, The Incred­i­ble Hulk. Shortly after the farm ani­mal sprang back to life and a crowd had gath­ered, Chuck Nor­ris round­house kicked the ani­mal, break­ing its neck, to remind the crew once more that Chuck giveth, and the good Chuck, he taketh away. Chuck Nor­ris built a time machine and went back in time to stop the JFK assas­si­na­tion.
